# My Journey with JavaScript
When I first started programming in JavaScript, I chose NetBeans as my development tool. I had already gained a decent understanding of Python and wanted to expand my programming horizons.

I began by following tutorials and creating programs recommended by them, much like I did with Python. As I progressed, I started building programs that I wanted to make for the experience and to see if I truly grasped the language.

I repeated the same process that had worked for me in the past, and it paid off. By building a diverse set of programs, I honed my skills and became more comfortable with JavaScript. Looking back on that time, I'm proud of the progress I made and excited to continue learning more about this powerful language.
